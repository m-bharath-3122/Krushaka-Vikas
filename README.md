# Krushaka-Vikas
Krushaka Vikas is a smart system that uses an ESP32 board with sensors to gather field data. It trains machine learning models on this data to forecast changes.  Apache Airflow runs the data processing tasks, and Metabase provides clear dashboards. Farmers get early warnings about conditions so they can act quickly and keep their crops healthy.
